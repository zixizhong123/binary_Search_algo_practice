Example 1:

      Input:
      N = 7, x = 0 
      arr = 1,2,8,10,11,12,19
      Output: -1
      Explanation: No element less 
      than 0 is found. So output 
      is "-1".
Example 2:

      Input:
      N = 7, x = 5 
      arr = 1,2,8,10,11,12,19
      Output: 1
      Explanation: Largest Number less than 5 is
      2 (i.e K = 2), whose index is 1(0-based 
      indexing).
